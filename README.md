# MCLauncher

This tool allows you to install several versions of Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition (Bedrock) side-by-side.
This is useful if you want to test beta versions, releases or anything else side-by-side without needing to uninstall and reinstall the game.

## Disclaimer
This tool will **not** help you to pirate the game; it requires that you have a Microsoft account which can be used to download Minecraft from the Store.

## Prerequisites
- A Microsoft account connected to Microsoft Store which **owns Minecraft for Windows 10**
- **Administrator permissions** on your user account (or access to an account that has)
- **Developer mode** enabled for app installation in Windows 10 Settings
- If you want to be able to use beta versions, you'll additionally need to **subscribe to the Minecraft Beta program using Xbox Insider Hub**.

## Setup
- Download the latest release from the [Releases](/releases) section. Unzip it somewhere.
- Run `MCLauncher.exe` to start the launcher.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Does this allow running multiple instances of Minecraft: Bedrock at the same time?**

At the time of writing, no. It allows you to _install_ multiple versions, but only one version can run at a time.
